# Not give a shit
# Getting injured and the responsibility lies with you( )

We talk a lot about being able to perform the best of our abilities. 99% of the self help books out there, talk about 

Counterintutively, the less i care about something and have no expectations - I perform better on it. A good example is how at one point i was completely focused on being able to get better crossfit and one day opening myself up for competing. Ended up going to the gym twice a day, was attacking all soughts of different things.
The same deal with weightloss.

Maybe you learn with age.
