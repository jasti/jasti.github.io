title: Best blogging setup yet
category: posts

My latest blog setup gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling. I use Jekyll (If you don't know what it is, drop everything and head to http://jekyllrb.com/ , i'll wait....)

Are you back? Good.

Jekyll has a bunch of custom themes available online, so it as easy as downloading Ruby, installing rubygems, downloading a bunch of gems and off you go.

## Limits me to get distracted by adding videos, images etc.

## no silly, its not sent from my ipod for real
