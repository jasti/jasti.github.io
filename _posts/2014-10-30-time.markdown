Alan watts quote and steve jobs quote


- Time is limited - we all know it, but don't internalize it
-- Number of weekends remaining 

30 now and I could be in the mode of producing something until the age of 55. There are exceptions like buffet or Munger, but for the most part, consumption life begins.

52 *  25 years  = 1300

In each year, assuming you have 10 close friends, families and relative. Per family, 2 birthdays, 2
Yearly weekend things = 10 * 2 = 20 per family. 20 * 25 = 500 weekends
Lifetime events another 50. Family get togethers, weddings etc etc. 
All of these can be considered to be equal to flossing. You don't necessarily enjoy it, but it is just something you have got to do.
