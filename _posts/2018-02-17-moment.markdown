Every moment is unique and nobody is exempt from the  unfolding of each moment. The fleeting feeling of the moment can  feel isolating but the impermanence of the moment is what makes it precious. A lot of pleasure can be had by being there when one moment freshly blooms after another.

The immediate question I have is - so what? What's the point of welcoming the next moment? To that, it's worth asking, if not this, what else? If I couldn't stay here and watch the events unfold, does it even matter that it happened?

If not this, what else?
