Not that I was against it but I didn’t see a strong reason to voluntarily give up a life I dearly enjoyed for an unknown quantity. This feels preposterous in retrospect. But so do most things that shoulder the weight of their consequence.</p>

     <!-- <div id = "no-mobile"><br/><small><p>We just spent a week in paradise and thought I’d note someplaces we enjoyed the most. If we didn’t absolutely love something about a place, it’s not on the list. Obviously these recommendations are heavily skewed towards what my wife and I like to do which mostly revolves around being outside as much as possible, eating good food and drinking good coffee &amp; beer. We are both vegetarian and although Hawaii’s cuisine is fairly meat-centric, we were able to find some pretty amazing vegetarian options. Also, normally we’d hike a lot more, but I sprained my left ankle pretty bad on the first day on a hike and chanced my right foot with a sea urchin while surfing. There are probably many amazing hikes I’m not covering here.</p>

     <!-- <div id = "no-mobile"><br/><small><p>For those of you who have explored Buddism, how many times have you heard that Buddhism is about being in the present moment? 
What often doesn’t get talked about is Buddhism’s relative priorities. Being present is an important concept of Buddhism but it’s not more important than the notion of clinging. Described differently, attachment.</p>

<p>We all tend to cling to more things than we realize in our day to day. For example, I’m currently clinging to writing this article. In the same way, society has reinforced that being present is the ‘it’ in Buddhism and therefore everyone should let go of responsibilities, past and the future and stay focussed on the present. Staying present brings a lot of clarity to one’s actions. It makes one experience the real you instead of passing life in a literal dream state.</p>

The fleeting feeling of the moment can  feel isolating but the impermanence of the moment is what makes it precious. A lot of pleasure can be had by being there when one moment freshly blooms after another.</p>

      <h4><span>November 24, 2017</span> </h4> <h3> <a href="/posts/ultra">Running a 50 mile ultramarathon</a></h3>
     <!-- <div id = "no-mobile"><br/><small><p>Four months ago, I signed up to run the The North Face 50 Mile Endurance Race in Marin County. I signed up the very next day after I went trail running for the first time. The Marin Headlands are so beautiful that I wanted a challenging excuse to spend more time exploring them. At 10,500 elevation delta, I hear that The North Face 50 is one of the most challenging 50 mile races in the US. 
<br /></p>
<center><img src="/images/blog/ultra/bib.jpg" width="400" height="400" /></center>
<p><br />
I had run a few marathons in the past but didn’t think running almost twice the distance was even possible. However, the ultramarathon somehow made it on my bucket list. A 50 mile race is more challenging than a marathon in two ways. First, obviously, it’s almost double the distance of a marathon and second, the hills. Most ultramarathons are on trails, and most trails have hills. Muscle fatigue occurs much faster on hills compared to road.
<br /></p>
<center><img src="/images/blog/ultra/marin2.jpg" width="400" height="400" /></center>
<p><br />
My training journey deserves an entire separate post. I’ll just say that it was extremely rewarding because I saw progress every single week. Onto the race.</p>

It’s hands down better than the regular Alpha Go which beat the best Alpha Go human player a year ago. The most fascinating thing about the achievement is its ability to self-learn based on logic.

Programming, writing, reading, working out and more recently, cooking. Although most of my music listening has moved online to a combination of Spotify, 8tracks and Pandora, there are a couple of reasons I still like to own my music offline. 
&lt;/br&gt;
First, if I am at a park or a place without Wi-Fi, I don’t want to be stranded without the music of my choice. Add to that the stupid data limits placed by phone networks which restrict your ability to stream music. Second, a lot of unique music is made by artists that don’t <a href="http://goo.gl/QFaaZ1">sell</a> their music, and therefore not available through Spotify type services.</p>

You have had the time to hire a few sales folks to go out and sell your product. The product is quite successful and a bunch of clients sign up for the product. How you onboard your client can be make or break for the long term relationship with the client. A lot of early stage companies focus on sales, but the secret sauce for long term growth and retention is implementation of the product. Obviously, you can’t have the later without the former, but I want to highlight why having a client solutions function can sometimes be as important as (if not more than) having a sales function.</p>

If you aren’t married already, the first question someone asks you after they hear that you got married is, ‘where is the honeymoon?’ I don’t know if people are genuinely interested or making conversation or are on auto-pilot. I want to believe that majority fall in the 3rd category. Honeymoons were introduced way back when so couples could get personal in an intimate setting, easing them into a physical relationship. Times have obviously changed. Similar to political lobbying, it doesn’t make sense, is expensive and the participants are playing with antiquated rules. Time to move on…</p>
