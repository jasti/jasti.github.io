      <div id = "no-mobile"><br/><small><p>We have all heard about how meditation is good for you. The benefits include peace of mind, happiness, stress-relief and a better quality of life among other things. Having said that, there is still a lot of mystery around the connection between the physical action of meditation and its benefits.</p>

      <div id = "no-mobile"><br/><small><p>Exploring data without knowing what you are looking for allows you to find results that you didn&rsquo;t know existed. Below is a chart from business school 101. The top right quandrant is seldom explored by companies that are not established as data-driven companies.</p>

      <div id = "no-mobile"><br/><small><p>Part of why I write these technical posts is to get a better understanding of a topic. You ask why I can&rsquo;t do this without writing it as as a blog post? It&rsquo;s like when you clean your house when you know you have guests coming. You could clean all the time, but you don&rsquo;t.</p>

      <div id = "no-mobile"><br/><small><p>After working for 6 years at Goldman Sachs (GS) doing a mix of software development and project management, I felt like I needed a career change. I was also doing my MBA while working at GS (a post for another time), which encouraged me to look into technology consulting.</p>

      <div id = "no-mobile"><br/><small><p>There is a lot of data locked behind the websites we visit every day. What you see on a page is usually just a tiny sliver of all the information that a website hosts. Some websites expose all this data via an <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a>, but most don&rsquo;t. <br></p>

      <div id = "no-mobile"><br/><small><p>Writing here has gotten me thinking more deeply about things I come across everyday. Talking comes naturally to me and I can spend days having conversations with friends with no real agenda, but I am not as good at writing concrete material and I wanted to work towards changing that. Thinking while speaking with someone usually gets me to a level or two, but writing down forces me to solidify my reflection on a thought.</p>

      <div id = "no-mobile"><br/><small><p>I am appalled at the difference in API usability between an API developed for B2B (Business to Business) vs. one developed for B2C (Business to Customer). A good example of a B2B API in the finance world is the <a href ="http://www.swift.com/products_services/by_type/messaging/index">15022 swift messaging</a> (primarily used for communication between two financial institutions) which look like a 5 year old&rsquo;s half eaten bowl of spaghetti. Compare that to a B2C API like  <a href ="https://parse.com/docs/rest">Parse</a> (a Backend as a service application) which has a beautifully designed API which is a pleasure to work with as a developer.</p>

Enter Stock Predictor - An open source project I authored that listens on Reuters via a twitter handle and screens the articles for positively or negatively correlated news for stocks you are interested in.</p>

      <div id = "no-mobile"><br/><small><p>Google made $50B in advertisement(Ad) revenue in 2013. Worth saying that again, FIFTY Billion. (Sure, when you compare that to the unbelievable doozy that FB made paying $19B for whatsapp, it doesn&rsquo;t sounds like a lot.)
I have clicked (voluntarily) on one single add in all my waking years,( It was a really tempting locally made cookie Ad) but i don&rsquo;t consider myself the average user either.</p>
