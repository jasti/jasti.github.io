  <p>
       I like Crossfit, travelling, drinking draft beer and working on side projects. I like side projects so much that i could do my side projects as a main project. 
       Used to work at a <a href="http://gs.com"> company</a> that everyone loves to hate and have an overrated degree from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University_Stern_School_of_Business"> here</a>. 
       Lets get in touch on : <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-twitter"></i></a> or via :<a href="mailto:vamseejastiATme.com?Subject=Hi%20from%20the%20blog" target="_top"><i class="icon-envelope"></i></a>

  <p> Big thanks to <a href ="https://github.com/holman/left">@holman</a> for open sourcing this jekyll theme and allowing me to steal and make modifications to it. I have open sourced a bare bones template of this blog. You can read more about it <a href ="http://vamseejasti.com/posts/blog/">here</a>.
