  <h4> A little about me and this blog </h4>

  <p>

    Hey, I'm Vamsee. My friends call me J-Dog.... no, nobody calls me that but I don't mind if you do though. I work at Google as a Product Manager. All the opinions on this blog are my own, blah blah.

  <p>
    I like to write about a diverse set of things. Ramblings, technology trends, data-driven experiments, hacks and travels.
  </p> 
  <p>I have open sourced a bare bones template of this blog if you want to use it. You can read more about it <a href ="http://vamseejasti.com/posts/blog/">here</a>.
   
Hit me up on the twitterverse if you'd like to chat about any of this: <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}" target="_blank"> <i class="icon icon-twitter"></i> </a> or via :<a href="mailto:vamseej@gmail.com?Subject=Hi%20from%20the%20blog" target="_top"><i class="icon icon-envelope"></i></a>
