    Hello! Welcome to this space. I enjoy travel, draft beer, staying fit and building cool things. 
    I work as a Technical Account Manager for advertising platforms at <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> and I have an MBA from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University_Stern_School_of_Business"> NYU Stern School of Business</a>. 
    Before joining Google, I used to work at Goldman Sachs as a software developer and Charles River Development as a Technical Implementation Manager for electronic trading platforms.  
  </p>

  <p>
  	I am also a certified CrossFit Level 1 Trainer and a fitness instructor at Google.

    I like to write about a diverse set of topics. Observations, technology trends, data-driven experiments, hacks and travels. Some of my posts are fairly technical, but I try and write for an audience who has taken at least one computer science class in their life. Feedback always appreciated. A quick note on gender. I often use the term 'he' as a convenience. Please feel free to <i>':%s/he/she/g'</i>. My apologies if this bothers you. 
  </p> 
  <p>I have open sourced a bare bones template of this blog if you want to use it. You can read more about it <a href ="http://vamseejasti.com/posts/blog/">here</a>.
