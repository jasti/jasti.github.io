  <p>
       I like Crossfit, traveling, drinking draft beer and working on side projects. I like side projects so much that I could do my side projects as a main project. 
       Used to work at a <a href="http://gs.com"> company</a> that everyone loves to hate and have an overrated degree from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University_Stern_School_of_Business"> here</a>. 
       Lets get in touch on : <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}" target="_blank"> <i class="icon icon-twitter"></i> </a> or via :<a href=â€œmailto:vamseej@gmail.com?Subject=Hi%20from%20the%20blog" target="_top"><i class="icon-envelope"></i> </a>
  </p>

  <p>Some of my posts are fairly technical, but I try and write for an audience who has taken at least one computer science class in their life. Feedback always appreciated.

  <p>I have open sourced a bare bones template of this blog if you want to use it. You can read more about it <a href ="http://vamseejasti.com/posts/blog/">here</a>.
