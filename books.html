<h3>Writing that works | Kenneth Roman & Joel Raphaelson </h3>
<center><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Works-Communicate-Effectively-Business/dp/0060956437"><img src="/images/books/writing.jpg"> </a></center>
<p>
Apparently this is classic, but I didn't come across this book until recently. You make your money's worth just by reading chapter 2. The authors describe effective principles for clear and concise writing. The book focuses on business writing instead of creative writing. It is especially useful if you are a non-native english speaker. I wish I had read it before I joined my first job. Could have avoided all those embarrassingly long emails. A must read!

Rarely a book comes along that is simple, yet so powerful. The creators of Basecamp talk about their thoughts on how a business should be run. It is rather unconventional, but feels completely obvious after you have digested it. It is a quick and easy read but packs a punch, just the way business books should be. Recommend it to any entrepreneur, manager or anyone who is curious about running a business or a team with a new set of rules.

<h3>Visualize This | Nathan Yau </h3>
<center><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Visualize-This-FlowingData-Visualization-Statistics-ebook/dp/B005CCT19M/"><img src="/images/books/visualize-this.png"> </a></center>
<p>
It was a course reading for one of my data science classes in my MBA, but I went back and re-read it. More than half of the book is covered with code and I skipped over it because your actual implementation is usually fairly restrictive in terms of choices in reality. However, the book does an excellent job of giving a broad idea about all the visulaizations possible and a broad overview of industry grade tools. Visualization is a relatively new subject and this book gives you a good grounding if you ever plan on working with visualizations.

<h3>Arguably | Christopher Hitchens </h3>
<center><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Arguably-Essays-Christopher-Hitchens-ebook/dp/B004QZ9PLK/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1"><img src="/images/books/arguably.jpeg"/></a></center>
<p>
Quintessential Hitchens. Brash, witty, condescending yet spacious observations on subjects that have been near and dear to him over the decades. Most people who have read Hitchens have polar feelings. You will either idolize or detest him. This book is no different. There are a lot of times that Hitchens assumes that the people reading his books know as much about subjects as he does and that's why he is a great writer's writer but for mere mortals like me, it takes a bit of brain massaging to get through.

<h3>Happiness | Matthieu Ricard </h3>
<center> <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Guide-Developing-Lifes-Important-ebook/dp/B000SEUSXW/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1"><img src="/images/books/happiness.jpg"/></a></center>
<p>
If you can get past beyond the corny title of the book, the material is discussed in a very intellectual tone and is quite inspiring. This is one of the best, if not the best, book on spiritualism I have come across. Matthieu lays out the Buddhist philosophy of training your mind to be happy in a very digestible manner directed at a modern audience.
