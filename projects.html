<h2>Stock Portfolio Viewer</h2>
<p>A C# Windows thick client that is useful for monitoring your own portfolio holdings. Simply edit the portfolio.xml file with the stocks you hold and the initial price you bought them at and run the solution. Real time equity data price feed from Yahoo has been implemented and also other performance ( Daily and Cost Basis) oriented metrics associated with your portfolio.
<br>

Makes it easier to just have this app open if you are on windows, instead of having to open a web browser each time you want to check your stock performance.

The UI is not exactly a piece of art, but gets the job done!

<h2>Stock Predictor</h2>

<p>A project written in python that listens on Reuters via a twitter handle and screens the articles for positively or negatively correlated news for stocks you are interested in. Based on the sentiment analysis of the news article, the program will suggest to take a direction on the stock. </p>
<p>
For example, if Reuters publishes a leak about Apple launching the iWatch and what a huge success it will become, the app will calculate a positive sentiment and mark it closer to 1. Depending on the exact sentiment score, the app will recommend buying a large number of stocks when the number gets closer to 1 and the app will recommend selling the stocks when the sentiment score is closer to 0. i.e shorting the stock.
