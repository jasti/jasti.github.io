<h2> Kristina & Vamsee's wedding logistics</h2>


<h3>Dress Code</h3>
<p>

It is casual. Please wear whatever you will find comfortable. For reference, Kristina will be in her wedding dress. Kristina's sister will be wearing a sun-dress. I will be wearing khakis and a button-down shirt. Aloha shirts are encouraged :)

<p>
<h3>Wedding & Reception Location</h3>
<p>

The wedding will be held at the Moonlight beach lookout. It is a small grassy park which overlooks the beach and the ocean. (So ladies, heels are OK). If you search for Moonlight beach on Google Maps, it should show an image similar to below. The <a href = "http://goo.gl/Fxo0JR">wedding </a> and <a href = "">reception</a> location are marked in the image.
Also, there will be no chairs and we will be standing during the short wedding ceremony. Please feel free to bring your own chair, if you would like to sit. <br>

<h3>Wedding & Reception Time</h3>
<p>
The wedding ceremony will begin at 6:00 PM and we will head over to El Callejon for some tacos and margaritas at 6.30 PM. 
<p>


<h3>Car Parking</h3>
<p>
There is car parking at Moonlight beach, right next to the lookout. You can also park at El Callejon and walk over to the lookout. If you are parking at El Callejon, please tell the front desk that you are parking there for our wedding. If you don't, there is a chance your car could be towed away :(

</p>
<h3>Friday Night BBQ</h3>
<p>
Kristina's parents are hosting a BBQ on Friday evening (18th Jul), starting at around 6 PM. If you are in town and hanging about, we would LOVE for you to come down. Rick 
(Kristina's dad) has agreed to serving up some tasty Mai Tai's and we'll have some grilled food and other nosh. They also have a lovely Jacuzzi, so bring your bathing suit!
